Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        block elements represent complete chunks of things that will take up the full width of a webpage and start a new line when the are done (examples: <h1>, <p>, <div>). inline elements can share their line with other things or fit in the middle of larger elements (examples: <span>, <img>, <a>)
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
         An element with position:absolute will be locked in a specific location, designated by the coder. If positioned absolutely with a parent object, it will follow that object. If it does not have a parent object, it will simply remain on the same part of the screen as the user scrolls.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        Select an element in CSS and give it display: inline-block, then give it padding, etc.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    block elements: <h1>, <div>, <p>. inline elements: <a>, <span>. inline-block element: <img>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
        The box model is made of a bunch of rectangles inside each other: Margin > Border > Padding > Content.
